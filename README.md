# ObservableChains

This demo project showcases different ways to write observables where one is dependent on the other. The primary focus of this effort is to consider the most readable and maintainable ways to do this. I have included comments at the top of every example class explaining the main difference from the previous example as well as some thoughts on the approach. You may feel free to use the codebase as a playground for your own rxjs experiments.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
